# Logical Expressions Lab
- Logical Operators
    - && 
       - AND
        - The result of "A && B" is true in the case that both A and B are true expressions
    - ||
        - OR
        - Result of "A || B" will be true if either values are true
    - !
        - NOT
        - The result is the opposite of the intended result
- De Morgan's Laws
    - Associative
        - ((A || B) || C = A || (B || C)
        - (A && B) && C = A && (B && C)
    - Commutative
        - A || B = B || A
        - A && B = B && A
    - Distributive
        - A && (B || C) = A && B || A && C
        - A || (B && C) = (A || B) && (A || C)
    - Identity
        - A || A = A
        - A && A = A
- De Morgan's Theorem
      - !( A || B) = !A && !B
          - The line states that the inverse of A OR B is equivalent to the inverse of of and AND the inverse of B
      - !( A && B) = !A || !B
          - The inverse of A ANDB is the same or the inverse of A OR the inverse of B
- Operator Precedence
    - Describes the order in which operators are carried out by the compiler within a single expression
        - () Parentheses
        - ! Logical NOT
        - * / % Multiplication, Division, and Modulus
        - + - Addittion and subtraction
        - < <= > >= Less/Greater Than Less/Greater Than or Equal To
        - == != Equal To and Not Equal to
        - && Logical AND
        - || Logical OR
        - = Assignment
        
# Algorithm to Solve Lab
- Must follow precendence.
- Keep track using working variables (workingVar)
- Begin with checking for parentheses
    - Evaluate all things in parentheses
- Find and apply all Logical NOTs
